One of my first (minimally useful) codes, from 2020. 
Here I simulate the return of a strategy based upon being long on small firms and short in big ones. This way we can analyze the risk associated with smaller firms. 
The data was collected by me, mainly using the Economatica platform.
However, the main benefit of this project is to use the code in the future to simulate portfolios and other strategies/possible risk factors.
As this was one of my first codes and I haven't used it since, it's not written efficiently.
If you have any questions or problems, I'll be happy to answer them.
